# MAC-FolderOrganizerByYear
The 'Folder Organizer By Year' AppleScript organizes folders in a selected directory by creation year. Users input a base name, and the script sorts folders into new directories named '[USER INPUT] - [YEAR]'. For example, 'Project - 2019'. It merges folders of the same year to streamline organization.
